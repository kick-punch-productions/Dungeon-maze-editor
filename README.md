# Dungeon-maze-editor
A JS dungeon-maze-editor that generates coordinate arrays for the walls or floors or both. Left-click or drag for floor. Shift-left-click for wall.
This is a tool I'm using to build for a WebGL project. I hope you will find use for it as well.
Floor and wall arrays have the format, [[x1,y1],[x2,y2], ... [xn,yn]] while the entire maze-dungeon has the fomat, [xn,yn,0] or [xn,yn,1] where 0 = floor and 1 = wall
